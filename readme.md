# React Skeleton App


<p>The purpose of this app is to create a framework to start new React projects quickly</p>


### In order to run this skeleton app
---
    1. **npm run build**
        purpose of this for transpiler / webpack
    2. __npm run start__
        purpose of this is to actually run the skeleton react app locally

### Things that I still need to do
    1) Add css / less / sass
